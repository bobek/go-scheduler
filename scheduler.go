AddSchedule adds a new Schedule to existing Scheduler.

- worker: anything what implements Worker interface.
- interval: time.Duration between runs of passed worker.

Provided `worker` will be called every `interval`. Scheduler will try to
compensate for delays. So the interval between runs will be actually shorter.

For example, let's assume, that schedule was started at 16:00:00 with interval
of 20s:
	16:00:00 1st execution took 5s -> scheduled to run after 15s
	16:00:20 2nd execution took 10s -> scheduled to run after 10s
	16:00:30 3rd execution took 1s -> scheduled to run after 19s
